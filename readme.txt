The current first iteration meeting has decided on the various members of the development team and clarified various tasks. As a technical development member of the team, I am conducting research on the technology and the subsequent uploading of git to github, which will facilitate the smooth development of our scrum project. Similarly, we have provided relevant suggestions for our clothing related e-commerce websites. For example, I suggest learning the layout design and distribution of Amazon website, and modifying and upgrading it to ultimately transform it into our own e-commerce website. In this meeting, I recorded the entire content of the meeting and organized and saved it so that specific actions can be taken in a certain direction and tasks, including the follow-up work of development. As a technical consultant, I provide corresponding services
